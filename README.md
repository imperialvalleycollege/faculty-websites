# Faculty Websites Application for Imperial Valley College

This repository will hold the new iteration of IVC's Faculty Websites Site.

- Currently making use of the Start Boostrap Admin 2 theme (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/)
- Will be using CKEditor as the WYSIWYG Editor for the site (http://ckeditor.com/)
- Will probably be using the DropzoneJS project for file uploads once we get to that stage (http://www.dropzonejs.com/)

## Getting started steps

Once the project progresses a little more I'll start writing some getting started and usage documentation and include it here in the README (or add the additional documentation files to the repository).
